## First Time Setup

### Frontend

If you don't already have _NodeJS_ installed, do so [here](https://nodejs.org/en) (I used 18.18.0 LTS, but anything with version 18 should work). During the installation make sure you check this box:

![Check the Chocolatey box!](readme-images\chocolatey_box.png)

Once _NodeJS_ is installed, in your terminal in the `frontend` folder run `npm install`.

Now the frontend should be good to go, read the [README.md](frontend/README.md) there for further info.
